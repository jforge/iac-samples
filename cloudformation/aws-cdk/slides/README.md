# AWS CDK Slides

The slides for a series of talks about AWS Cloud Development Kit are based on Markdown and rendered as browser-based Reveal.js with Reveal-md.

## Reveal-md

[Reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md)

[Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

## Reveal.js

[Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/)

### Controls

See [Keyboard Shortcuts](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Keyboard-Shortcuts)
for Reveal.js.

### Export Formats

### Math expressions

Reveal.js allows use of third party plugin like [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/)
to support math expression rendering.

Example:

```js
$\cos (2\theta) = \cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta$
```

Reveal-md already contains the [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) plugin
and you can add the above expression as is into the markdown source.

The dollar sign encapsulates the expression, see the MathJax and Reveal.js docs
for the notation.
